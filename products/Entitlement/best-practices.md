# Entitlement API Best Practices

## Overview

This guide outlines recommended practices for integrating with and using the Entitlement API efficiently. Following these guidelines will help ensure optimal performance, reliability, and security in your implementation.

## API Usage Recommendations

### Pagination

The Entitlement API supports pagination to efficiently handle large datasets:

- Use the `limit` parameter to control the number of results per response (1-100, default 20)
- Use the `offset` parameter to navigate through result pages
- Monitor the `total` field in responses to track overall result counts
- Consider implementing cursor-based pagination for frequently changing datasets

```
GET /entitlements?limit=50&offset=100
```

### Filtering and Searching

For efficient data retrieval:

- Use the dedicated search endpoint (`/entitlements/search`) for complex queries
- Construct targeted filter expressions for the search endpoint
- Avoid overly broad searches that return unnecessarily large result sets

```
POST /entitlements/search
{
  "filter": "status=FULFILLED AND end_date>2023-01-01"
}
```

### Resource Updates

When updating entitlement records:

- Always use the `updateMask` query parameter to specify which fields are being updated
- Only send the fields that are changing, not the entire resource
- Verify the current state before updating to avoid race conditions

```
PATCH /entitlements/123?updateMask=status,end_date
{
  "status": "FULFILLED",
  "end_date": "2023-12-31"
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Request Batching

- Batch create or update operations when possible
- Avoid making numerous small requests in quick succession
- Consider using bulk operations for large-scale changes

### Caching Strategy

Implement appropriate caching:

- Cache immutable or slowly changing entitlement data
- Set appropriate cache expiration times based on data volatility
- Include version information in your cache keys to handle updates
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for when data changes

### Rate Limiting Considerations

- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Respect rate limit headers in responses
- Distribute requests evenly rather than sending in bursts
- Consider implementing a queuing system for high-volume operations

## Error Handling

### Robust Error Management

- Always check HTTP status codes in responses
- Parse and log detailed error messages from response bodies
- Implement appropriate retry logic with backoff for 429 (Too Many Requests) and 5xx errors
- Have fallback mechanisms for critical operations

### Logging and Monitoring

- Log all API interactions with appropriate detail
- Track response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns or elevated error rates
- Maintain audit logs for entitlement changes

## Security Best Practices

### Token Management

- Rotate API access tokens regularly
- Never expose tokens in client-side code
- Store tokens securely using appropriate secret management tools
- Use the principle of least privilege when assigning token permissions

### Data Protection

- Only request and store the entitlement data you need
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regularly audit access to entitlement data

## Integration Patterns

### Webhooks vs. Polling

- Consider implementing webhook receivers for real-time updates
- If using polling, use appropriate intervals to balance freshness and load
- Implement idempotent processing for webhook events

### Microservice Architecture

- Consider using an API gateway to manage authentication and rate limiting
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Use message queues for asynchronous processing of entitlement changes

## Testing and Validation

- Thoroughly test your integration in a sandbox environment before production
- Create automated tests covering standard operations and edge cases
- Validate entitlement data formats and business rules on your side
- Implement monitoring to detect anomalies in production

## API Version Management

- Stay informed about API version changes and deprecation notices
- Test your integration against new API versions before migrating
- Design your code to be adaptable to API changes
- Include API version information in error reports and logs

By following these best practices, you can create a robust, efficient, and secure integration with the Entitlement API.
