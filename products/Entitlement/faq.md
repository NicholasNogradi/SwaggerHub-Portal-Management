# Entitlement API Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Entitlement API?

The Entitlement API allows you to programmatically manage and query entitlement records following AIP (API Improvement Proposals) standards. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and searching entitlements in your system.

### What version of the API is currently available?

The current version is v1, accessible at `https://api.example.com/v1`.

### Is there a sandbox environment available for testing?

Yes, we provide a sandbox environment at `https://sandbox-api.example.com/v1` where you can test your integration without affecting production data.

### What data formats are supported?

The API supports JSON for both requests and responses. All endpoints accept and return data in JSON format.

## Authentication and Access

### How do I authenticate with the API?

The API supports OAuth 2.0 authentication. See our [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) for detailed instructions.

### What permissions do I need to access the API?

You need appropriate scopes based on your operations:
- `entitlements.read` for read operations
- `entitlements.write` for create and update operations
- Additional specialized scopes for specific operations

### How long are access tokens valid?

Standard access tokens are valid for 1 hour. Refresh tokens typically expire after 30 days.

### How do I handle token expiration?

Implement token refresh logic in your application to automatically obtain new access tokens using your refresh token before they expire.

## Rate Limits and Quotas

### Are there rate limits on the API?

Yes, the API employs rate limiting based on your subscription tier:
- Basic tier: 100 requests per minute
- Premium tier: 500 requests per minute
- Enterprise tier: Custom limits based on contract

### What happens if I exceed the rate limit?

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff in your application to handle these cases.

### How can I monitor my API usage?

Usage metrics are available in the Developer Portal dashboard, updated hourly.

## Working with Entitlements

### What is an entitlement record?

An entitlement record represents a customer's right to use a specific product or service. It contains details such as the product identifier (SKU), validity period, quantity, and status.

### How do I create a new entitlement?

Use a POST request to `/entitlements` with the entitlement details in the request body. See the [How-to Guide](./how-to-guide.md) for examples.

### How do I update an existing entitlement?

Use a PATCH request to `/entitlements/{entitlementID}` with the fields you want to update. Always include the `updateMask` query parameter to specify which fields you're updating.

### What are the possible statuses for an entitlement?

Entitlements can have the following statuses:
- `FULFILLED`: The entitlement is active and in use
- `PENDING`: The entitlement has been created but is not yet active
- `CANCELED`: The entitlement has been canceled

### How can I search for specific entitlements?

Use the `/entitlements/search` endpoint with a POST request containing a filter expression in the request body.

### Can I get entitlements in bulk?

Yes, use the standard GET endpoint with appropriate pagination parameters (`limit` and `offset`) to retrieve multiple records at once.

## Pagination and Filtering

### How does pagination work?

The API uses offset-based pagination:
- Use `limit` to control the number of results per page (default 20, max 100)
- Use `offset` to specify the starting point
- The response includes `total` for the total number of matching records

### What is the maximum number of records I can retrieve in one request?

The maximum page size (`limit` parameter) is 100 records.

### How do I filter entitlements by date range?

Use the search endpoint with a filter expression like:
```
start_date>='2023-01-01' AND end_date<='2023-12-31'
```

### How can I filter entitlements by multiple criteria?

Combine filter conditions using logical operators (AND, OR) in your search request.

## Error Handling

### What HTTP status codes should I expect?

- 200: Successful operation
- 201: Resource created successfully
- 400: Bad request (invalid parameters)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication issue)
- 403: Forbidden (permission issue)
- 404: Resource not found
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 500: Server error

### How should I handle API errors?

Always check the HTTP status code and error message in the response body. Implement appropriate error handling and retry logic in your application.

### What information is included in error responses?

Error responses include:
- HTTP status code
- Error code
- Error message
- Request ID (for support reference)
- Additional details when applicable

## Webhooks and Notifications

### Does the API support webhooks for entitlement changes?

Yes, you can configure webhooks in the Developer Portal to receive notifications about entitlement events.

### What events can trigger webhooks?

Webhook events include:
- `entitlement.created`
- `entitlement.updated` 
- `entitlement.status_changed`
- `entitlement.expiring_soon`
- `entitlement.expired`

### How do I verify webhook authenticity?

Webhooks include a signature header that you should validate using your webhook secret to ensure they come from our service.
